    "\n",
    "## Key Terms & Concepts\n",
    "- Client: name of the individual or business you are working with for your Capstone Project\n",

    "## 1. Define the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Sales data is not easily accessible for the company I am consulting with. Since it is not readily accessible, it is difficult to visualize, make statistical assessments, and formulate accurate forecasts for future sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "I want to consolidate the data from different locations, visualize it, use statistics to further analyze the data, and formulate accurate forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Identify your client\n",
    "\n",
    "My client would be the sales organization for the company. Better understanding sales performance of the group will allow management to more accurately forecast future sales and benchmark individual performance. They care about this problem because it is difficult to benchmark individual contributor performance without an accurate visual and analysis tool. Based on this data, the company would make more informed personnel and strategic decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Describe your data set, and how you cleaned/wranged it\n",
    "\n",
    "I am using the sales data for an organization to predict future performance. The sales data comes from two databases, and is provided to me in CSV format. I will import the data, clean it, and merge them into a single dataframe using pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the new system csv file as dataframe ns\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Drop unnecessary columns <br>\n",
    "    2. Define column names Date, Type, Region, and Value. <br>\n",
    "    3. Fill column 'Type' with appropriate values. We include column 'Type' per client's request. <br>\n",
    "    4. Populate ‘Region’ column with Americas, EMEA, or APAC <br>\n",
    "       1. The new system database contains values for each entry as a two character abbreviation of the country. We want to group the countries into Americas, EMEA, and APAC buckets. We do this first by identifying top 5 countries the company most frequently sells to and manually changing those country codes with the appropriate region identification (Americas, etc.). For the rest of the countries, we double iterate through the new system dataframe and a country dataframe which contains the country codes and corresponding regions. In this iteration we replace the country codes in the new system with the appropriate regions as defined in the country dataframe. We make the manual change first before performing the double iteration on all entries to save processing time.\n",
    "2. Load the old system csv file as dataframe os <br>\n",
    "\t1. Remove sensitive information from the new dataframe os. <br>\n",
    "    2. Create keywords to help identify from which region the sale was made <br>\n",
    "    3. iterate through the old system data and assign regions (Americas, EMEA, APAC) to each data point using the keywords <br>\n",
    "    4. fill all null values in the ‘State’ column with -1 so that we can quantify the amount left unassigned to the Americas, EMEA, and APAC regions. <br>\n",
    "    5. format the columns to match the same formatting as the new system dataframe. <br>\n",
    "3. Merge old system and new system into a single data frame, fs <br>\n",
    "\t1. Reformat the full system dataframe fs\n",
    "\t\t1. Create new columns for each region and transpose the data\n",
    "\t\t2. Create a ‘Total’ column which represents the sum of all business\n",
    "\t\t3. Remove the ‘Type’ column\n",
    "\t2. Create two new dataframes from ‘fs.’ Dataframe fs_year displays the aggregated sales data for each year and for each region. Dataframe fs_year_month displays the aggregated sales data for each month formatted as YEAR-MO\n",
    "    \n",
    "## 4. List other potential data sets you could use\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Number of operating plants in specific geographical regions\n",
    "2. Annual economic indicators from specific regions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Explain your initial findings\n",
    "\n",
    "Annual sales have historically been approximately \\\\$2m until the mid-2000s, when total sales began to increase to approximately \\\\$3m average. Annual sales increased again in 2015 to approximately \\\\$6m. Sales seem to have reached a plateau over the past 3 to 4 years. Americas have historically generated the majority of annual sales, followed by APAC and then by EMEA. 2018 was the first year where sales from EMEA or APAC exceeded that from Americas. The reason is due to an unusually large order in 2018 for about \\\\$4.2m. \n",
    "Annual medical sales has steadily declined from \\\\$3m annual sales in 2006 to \\\\$1m in 2018. \n",
    "Annual number of orders has been trending downwards, while average value per order has increased. Average number of industrial orders has decreased by 60% since early 90s, from 600 annual orders to about 250 in 2018. The average value of orders has increased tenfold since sales data was introduced in 1985, from about \\\\$3,000 per order to about \\\\$30,000 in 2018. This may be an indication of the following:\n",
    "1. More efficient sales processes \n",
    "2. Price elasticity of demand is relatively inelastic, since sales have increased while number of orders has decreased.\n",
    "3. Price increases have exceeded the inflation rate, since \\\\$100 in 1985 is equivalent to \\\\$237.50 in 2019, only accounting for an increase of 137%. Average order value has increased approximately 1000% over the same time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Americas region offers more stable sales than the APAC and EMEA regions, mostly due to the consistent annual number of orders from Americas. Over the past 5 years, Americas averages 197 orders, with a standard deviation of 12.5 orders. APAC averages 29 with a standard deviation of 4.72, and EMEA averages 12 with a standard deviation of 3.56. Sales for Americas averages \\\\$2.59m annually, with a standard deviation of \\\\$668k. APAC averages \\\\$2.07m with a standard deviation of \\\\$1.08m, and EMEA averages \\\\$1.13m with a standard deviation of \\\\$1.81m."
